# Candyman Trivia

## Description 

![Sample page image](./assets/sample.JPG)

A simple guesser game to test out DOM manipulation and leveraging local storage. The idea is as old as time, candy is delicious, but you're always left wondering: 

* "How much nugget is in there?"
* "Is there caramel in the center?"
* "WHAT MAKES THIS SO DELICIOUS!?"

Well now you can try your hand at guessing. Try out the [Candyman](https://github.com/clubkemp/uw-trivia/blob/master/assets/Sample.JPG) to test your hand and see just how much candybar knowledge you have. How many can you guess in 60s.

The application is built on using vanilla Javascript, as an excercise in using vanilla JS to manipulate the DOM. Bootstrap was used to quickly get the elements onto a semi-decent looking page for deployment


## Installation

Clone the repo using https to tweak the code. To run the game visit [Candyman](https://clubkemp.github.io/uw-trivia)


## Usage 

1. click start
2. use the radio buttons to pick which candybar you think the cross section is
3. if you are right you will get a point, if you are wrong you will get deducted 10s
4. once you are done, and think your score is pretty good and you initials to the scoreboard
5. scores are saved in local storage, so anyone that plays again on your machine can see your scores
